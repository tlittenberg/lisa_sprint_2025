# Welcome The 3rd LISA Sprint
April 28-30 2025

Huntsville, AL

## Announcement
The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a joint effort of ESA and NASA to develop and operate the first space-based observatory of gravitational waves (GWs) in the millihertz frequency band. To prepare for LISA observations and its unique data products, we are organizing the 3rd LISA Sprint in Huntsville, AL, from Monday April 28 to Wednesday April 30, 2025. 
The meeting's goals will be two-fold: The first goal is to connect LISA data scientists with astronomers and astrophysicists who will incorporate LISA data products into their own research. The second is to advance the broader research community’s readiness to capitalize on LISA observations. 

The theme for this third meeting is Time Domain and Multimessenger Astronomy with LISA. During the workshop small interdisciplinary teams of researchers will come together and make concrete progress on concise projects and goals related to this scientific area. A number of project ideas and mock data and/or data products will be produced and provided by the organizers in collaboration with experts in the field. Additionally, participants are encouraged to propose ideas and contribute further material that adheres to the workshop’s format. 
 
This will be a hands-on workshop: there will be no talks--only brief project “pitches” at the beginning of the workshop, and “show and tell” at the close of the meeting to share progress with the group.

In early January 2025 we will advertise the meeting website and application form for interested participants.  Please note that space will be limited, so applying does not guarantee acceptance. Accepted applicants will be notified by the end of February. There is no financial support available to attend the meeting, nor is there any registration fee for participating.
